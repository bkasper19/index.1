	Write algorithm that would prompt a user to guess a number between 1-10.
	Program should tell user if the guess is too high or too low. If guess is correct,
	How many guesses did it take.
	1. code that spitsout number to guess
	2. Prompt that pops up so they can guess a number. loop this if guess is wrong
	3. We need to know how many guesses they take
	4. after they guess, if wrong give prompt again with box to guess again
	5. If guess is right, pop up alert with congratulations and the number of guesses
